# Outlook Today: Black Edition
Black version of Outlook Today for Outlook

Microsoft probably forgor about existence of this thing, and the default white theme with the black theme of Office is kinda jarring. After a bit of shenanigoogles I found out how to change things up, and made this dark version of Outlook Today.
